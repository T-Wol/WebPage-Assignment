<p>Hello, my name is Thomas Wolters. I am a 23 years old and a CIS major here at Pitt State.
    I was born in Memphis Tennessee but lived in small town called Oologah, Oklahoma my whole life.
    I have an associates degree in Air Traffic Control which I aquired at Tulsa Community College. 
    Unfortunately, Covid hit and I decided to change my degree. A couple of my friends were attending
    Pitt State so I wanted to give CIS a try. I moved up to Pittsburg in Summer 2021 and I live with two friends that I've known for years.
    my hobbies are watching sports, playing videogames, and hanging out with my close friends. 
    I'm excited to learn more about HTML, Javascript, and CSS this semester so that it can help me 
    at my future job. </p>
